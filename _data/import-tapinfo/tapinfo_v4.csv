ABI3/VP1	Suzuki et al (1997): When expressed and purified as a separate peptide, the B3 domain has a highly cooperative DNA binding activity that is specific for the Sph sequence. We find that the properties of this activity are in compelling agreement with the functional analyses of VP1 and regulatory sequences in the C7 promoter. These results identify a new class of DNA binding proteins, which thus far are known only in the plant kingdom, that have critical functions in development.

AP2/EREBP	Riechmann & Meyerowitz (1998): AP2 (APETALA2) and EREBPs (ethylene-responsive element binding proteins) are the prototypic members of a family of transcription factors unique to plants, whose distinguishing characteristic is that they contain the so-called AP2 DNA-binding domain. AP2/ REBP genes form a large multigene family, and they play a variety of roles throughout the plant life cycle: from being key regulators of several developmental processes, like floral organ identity determination or control of leaf epidermal cell identity, to forming part of the mechanisms used by plants to respond to various types of biotic and environmental stress.

ARF	Guilfoyle et al (1998): Auxin response factors or ARFs are a recently discovered family of transcription factors that bind with specificity to auxin response elements (AuxREs) in promoters of primary or early auxin-responsive genes. ARFs have an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain related to the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain in the maize transactivator VIVIPAROUS1. All but one ARF identified to date contain a carboxyl-terminal protein-protein interaction domain that forms a putative amphipathic alpha-helix. A similar carboxyl-terminal protein-protein interaction domain is found in the Aux/IAA class of auxin-inducible proteins. Some ARFs contain transcriptional activation domains, while others contain repression domains. ARFs appear to play a pivotal role in auxin-regulated gene expression of primary response genes.

ARID	Kortschak et al (2000): Members of the recently discovered ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) family of DNA-binding proteins are found in fungi and invertebrate and vertebrate metazoans. ARID-encoding genes are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, cell lineage gene regulation and cell cycle control. Although the specific roles of this domain and of ARID-containing proteins in transcriptional regulation are yet to be elucidated, they include both positive and negative transcriptional regulation and a likely involvement in the modification of chromatin structure.

Alfin-like	Bastola et al (1998): Alfin1 cDNA, obtained by differential screening of a poly(A)+ library from salt-tolerant alfalfa cells, encodes a novel protein with a Cys4 and His/Cys3 putative zinc-binding domain that suggests a possible role for this protein in transcriptional regulation. We have expressed the cDNA in Escherichia coli and show that the recombinant Alfin1 protein binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The DNA recognition sequence was determined from individual clones isolated after four rounds of random oligonucleotide selection in gel retardation assays, coupled with PCR amplification of the selected sequences. The consensus binding site for Alfin1 is shown to contain two to five G-rich triplets with the conserved core of GNGGTG or GTGGNG in clones showing high-efficiency binding. DNA binding of the recombinant Alfin1 was inhibited by EDTA. Alfin1 mRNA was found predominantly in alfalfa roots. Growth of salt-sensitive Medicago sativa L on 171 mM NaCl led to a slight decrease in Alfin1 mRNA, while the salt-tolerant plants showed no decrease in Alfin1 mRNA levels. Interestingly, recombinant Alfin1 binds efficiently to three fragments of the MsPRP2 promoter, each containing consensus sequences identified by the random oligonucleotide selection. Since MsPRP2 transcripts were shown to be root-specific and accumulated in alfalfa roots in a salt-inducible manner, Alfin1 may play a role in the regulated expression of MsPRP2 in alfalfa roots and contribute to salt tolerance in these plants.

Argonaute	Rogers & Weiche (2013): MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that control gene expression through silencing of target mRNAs. Mature miRNAs are processed from primary miRNA transcripts by the endonuclease activity of the DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) protein complex. Mechanisms exist that allow the DCL1 complex to precisely excise the miRNA from its precursor. Our understanding of miRNA biogenesis, particularly its intersection with transcription and other aspects of RNA metabolism such as splicing, is still evolving. Mature miRNAs are incorporated into an ARGONAUTE (AGO) effector complex competent for target gene silencing but are also subjected to turnover through a degradation mechanism that is beginning to be understood. The mechanisms of miRNA target silencing in plants are no longer limited to AGO-catalyzed slicing, and the contribution of translational inhibition is increasingly appreciated. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying the biogenesis, turnover, and activities of plant miRNAs.

Aux/IAA	Tiwari et al (2004): Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that repress expression of primary/early auxin response genes in protoplast transfection assays. Repression is thought to result from Aux/IAA proteins dimerizing with auxin response factor (ARF) transcriptional activators that reside on auxin-responsive promoter elements, referred to as AuxREs. Most Aux/IAA proteins contain four conserved domains, designated domains I, II, III, and IV. Domain II and domains III and IV play roles in protein stability and dimerization, respectively. A clear function for domain I had not been established. Results reported here indicate that domain I in Aux/IAA proteins is an active repression domain that is transferable and dominant over activation domains. An LxLxL motif within domain I is important for conferring repression. The dominance of Aux/IAA repression domains over activation domains in ARF transcriptional activators provides a plausible explanation for the repression of auxin response genes via ARF-Aux/IAA dimerization on auxin-responsive promoters.

BBR/BPC	Santi et al (2003): The barley b recombinant (BBR) protein binds specifically to the (GA/TC)8 repeat. BBR is nuclear targeted and is a characterized nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, a DNA-binding domain extended up to 90 aa at the C-terminus and a putative N-terminal activation domain. The corresponding gene has no introns and is ubiquitously expressed in barley tissues. In co-transfection experiments, BBR activates (GA/TC)8-containing promoters, and its overexpression in tobacco leads to a pronounced leaf shape modification. BBR has properties of a GAGA-binding factor, but the corresponding gene has no sequence homology to Trl and Psq of Drosophila, which encode functionally analogous proteins.

BES1	Yin et al (2005): Brassinosteroids (BRs) signal through a plasma membrane-localized receptor kinase to regulate plant growth and development. We showed previously that a novel protein, BES1, accumulates in the nucleus in response to BRs, where it plays a role in BR-regulated gene expression; however, the mechanism by which BES1 regulates gene expression is unknown. In this study, we dissect BES1 subdomains and establish that BES1 is a transcription factor that binds to and activates BR target gene promoters both in vitro and in vivo. BES1 interacts with a basic helix-loop-helix protein, BIM1, to synergistically bind to E box (CANNTG) sequences present in many BR-induced promoters. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants of BIM1 and its close family members display BR response phenotypes. Thus, BES1 defines a new class of plant-specific transcription factors that cooperate with transcription factors such as BIM1 to regulate BR-induced genes.	"Li, L; Deng, XW. 2005.

C2C2_Dof	Yanagisawa (2004): Dof (DNA-binding with one finger) domain proteins are plant-specific transcription factors with a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, which presumably includes a single C(2)-C(2) zinc finger. During the past decade, numerous Dof domain proteins have been identified in both monocots and dicots including maize, barley, wheat, rice, tobacco, Arabidopsis, pumpkin, potato, and pea. Biochemical, molecular biological and molecular genetic analyses revealed that Dof domain proteins function as a transcriptional activator or a repressor involved in diverse plant-specific biological processes. Although more physiological roles of Dof domain proteins would be elucidated in future because of numerous Dof domain proteins in plants, it is already evident that the Dof domain proteins play critical roles as transcriptional regulators in plant growth and development.

CPP	Cvitanich et al (2000): Nodulin genes are specifically expressed in the nitrogen-fixing root nodules. We have identified a novel type of DNA-binding protein (CPP1) interacting with the promoter of the soybean leghemoglobin gene Gmlbc3. The DNA-binding domain of CPP1 contains two similar Cys-rich domains with 9 and 10 Cys, respectively. Genes encoding similar domains have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, the mouse, and human. The domains also have some homology to a Cys-rich region present in some polycomb proteins. The cpp1 gene is induced late in nodule development and the expression is confined to the distal part of the central infected tissue of the nodule. A constitutively expressed cpp1 gene reduces the expression of a Gmlbc3 promoter-gusA reporter construct in Vicia hirsuta roots. These data therefore suggest that CPP1 might be involved in the regulation of the leghemoglobin genes in the symbiotic root nodule.

Coactivator p15	Kretzschmar et al (1994): Functional deletion analyses revealed a bipartite structure of p15 comprising an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxy-terminal cryptic DNA-binding domain. We provide evidence that activity of p15 is controlled by protein kinases that target the regulatory domain.

CudA	Yamada et al (2008): The CudA and ECudA DNA-binding sites contain a dyad and, consistent with a symmetrical binding site, CudA forms a homodimer in the yeast two-hybrid system. The CudA and ECudA proteins share a 120 amino acid core of homology, and clustered point mutations introduced into two highly conserved motifs within the ECudA core region decrease its specific DNA binding in vitro. This region, the presumptive DNA-binding domain, is similar in sequence to domains in two Arabidopsis proteins and one Oryza protein. Significantly, these are the only proteins in the two plant species that contain an SH2 domain. Such a structure, with a DNA-binding domain located upstream of an SH2 domain, suggests that the plant proteins are orthologous to metazoan STATs.

Dicer	Rogers & Chen (2013): MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that control gene expression through silencing of target mRNAs. Mature miRNAs are processed from primary miRNA transcripts by the endonuclease activity of the DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) protein complex. Mechanisms exist that allow the DCL1 complex to precisely excise the miRNA from its precursor. Our understanding of miRNA biogenesis, particularly its intersection with transcription and other aspects of RNA metabolism such as splicing, is still evolving. Mature miRNAs are incorporated into an ARGONAUTE (AGO) effector complex competent for target gene silencing but are also subjected to turnover through a degradation mechanism that is beginning to be understood. The mechanisms of miRNA target silencing in plants are no longer limited to AGO-catalyzed slicing, and the contribution of translational inhibition is increasingly appreciated. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying the biogenesis, turnover, and activities of plant miRNAs.

GRF	Kim et al (2003): Previously, we identified a novel rice gene, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1 (OsGRF1), which encodes a putative transcription factor that appears to play a regulatory role in stem elongation. We now describe the GRF gene family of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGRF), which comprises nine members. The deduced AtGRF proteins contain the same characteristic regions--the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains--as do OsGRF1 and related proteins in rice, as well as features indicating a function in transcriptional regulation. Most of the AtGRF genes are strongly expressed in actively growing and developing tissues, such as shoot tips, flower buds, and roots, but weakly in mature stem and leaf tissues. Overexpression of AtGRF1 and AtGRF2 resulted in larger leaves and cotyledons, as well as in delayed bolting of the inflorescence stem when compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, triple insertional null mutants of AtGRF1-AtGRF3 had smaller leaves and cotyledons, whereas single mutants displayed no changes in phenotype and double mutants displayed only minor ones. The alteration of leaf growth in overexpressors and triple mutants was based on an increase or decrease in cell size, respectively. These results indicate that AtGRF proteins play a role in the regulation of cell expansion in leaf and cotyledon tissues.	"Kim, JH; Choi, D; Kende, H. 2003.

GeBP	Curaba et al (2003): Trichomes of Arabidopsis are single-celled epidermal hair that are a useful model for studying plant cell fate determination. Trichome initiation requires the activity of the GLABROUS1 (GL1) gene whose expression in epidermal and trichome cells is dependent on the presence of a 3'-cis-regulatory element. Using a one-hybrid screen, we have isolated a cDNA, which encodes for a protein, GL1 enhancer binding protein (GeBP), that binds this regulatory element in yeast and in vitro. GeBP and its three homologues in Arabidopsis share two regions: a central region with no known motifs and a C-terminal region with a putative leucine-zipper motif. We show that both regions are necessary for trans-activation in yeast. A translational fusion with the Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) indicates that GeBP is a nuclear protein whose localization is restricted to, on average, 3-5 subnuclear foci that might correspond to nucleoli. Transcriptional fusion with the GUS reporter indicates that GeBP is mainly expressed in vegetative meristematic tissues and in very young leaf primordia. We looked at GeBP expression in plants mutated in or misexpressing KNAT1, a KNOX gene, expressed in the shoot apical meristem and downregulated in leaf founder cells, and found that GeBP transcript level is regulated by KNAT1 suggesting that KNAT1 is a transcriptional activator of GeBP. This regulation suggests that GeBP is acting as a repressor of leaf cell fate.	"Chevalier, F; Perazza, D; Laporte, F; Le Hénanff, G; Hornitschek, P; Bonneville, JM; Herzog, M; Vachon, G. 2008.

HRT	Raventós et al (1998): A barley gene encoding a novel DNA-binding protein (HRT) was identified by southwestern screening with baits containing a gibberellin phytohormone response element from an alpha-amylase promoter. The HRT gene contains two introns, the larger of which (5722 base pairs (bp)) contains a 3094-bp LINE-like element with homology to maize Colonist1. In vitro mutagenesis and zinc- and DNA-binding assays demonstrate that HRT contains three unusual zinc fingers with a CX8-9CX10CX2H consensus sequence. HRT is targeted to nuclei, and homologues are expressed in other plants. In vivo, functional tests in plant cells indicate that full-length HRT can repress expression from certain promoters including the Amy1/6-4 and Amy2/32 alpha-amylase promoters. In contrast, truncated forms of HRT containing DNA-binding domains can activate, or derepress, transcription from these promoters. Northern hybridizations indicate that HRT mRNA accumulates to low levels in various tissues. Roles for HRT in mediating developmental and phytohormone-responsive gene expression are discussed.

HSF	Wu (1995): Organisms respond to elevated temperatures and to chemical and physiological stresses by an increase in the synthesis of heat shock proteins. The regulation of heat shock gene expression in eukaryotes is mediated by the conserved heat shock transcription factor (HSF). HSF is present in a latent state under normal conditions; it is activated upon heat stress by induction of trimerization and high-affinity binding to DNA and by exposure of domains for transcriptional activity. Analysis of HSF cDNA clones from many species has defined structural and regulatory regions responsible for the inducible activities. The heat stress signal is thought to be transduced to HSF by changes in the physical environment, in the activity of HSF-modifying enzymes, or by changes in the intracellular level of heat shock proteins.

LFY	Parcy et al (1998): The initial steps of flower development involve two classes of consecutively acting regulatory genes. Meristem-identity genes, which act early to control the initiation of flowers, are expressed throughout the incipient floral primordium. Homeotic genes, which act later to specify the identity of individual floral organs, are expressed in distinct domains within the flower. The link between the two classes of genes has remained unknown so far. Here we show that the meristem-identity gene LEAFY has a role in controlling homeotic genes that is separable from its role in specifying floral fate. On the basis of our observation that LEAFY activates different homeotic genes through distinct mechanisms, we propose a genetic framework for the control of floral patterning.

LIM	Kawaoka et al (2000): The AC-rich motif, Pal-box, is an important cis-acting element for gene expression involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. A cDNA clone (Ntlim1) encoding a Pal-box binding protein was isolated by Southwestern screening. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly similar to the members of the LIM protein family that contain a zinc finger motif. Moreover, Ntlim1 had a specific DNA binding ability and transiently activated the transcription of a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the Pal-box sequence in tobacco protoplasts. The transgenic tobacco plants with antisense Ntlim1 showed low levels of transcripts from some key phenylpropanoid pathway genes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, hydroxycinnamate CoA ligase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. Furthermore, a 27% reduction of lignin content was observed in the transgenic tobacco with antisense Ntlim1.	"Eliasson, A; Gass, N; Mundel, C; Baltz, R; Kräuter, R; Evrard, JL; Steinmetz, A. 2000.

LUG	Conner & Liu (2000): Regulation of homeotic gene expression is critical for proper developmental patterns in both animals and plants. LEUNIG is a key regulator of the Arabidopsis floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS. Mutations in LEUNIG cause ectopic AGAMOUS mRNA expression in the outer two whorls of a flower, leading to homeotic transformations of floral organ identity as well as loss of floral organs. We isolated the LEUNIG gene by using a map-based approach and showed that LEUNIG encodes a glutamine-rich protein with seven WD repeats and is similar in motif structure to a class of functionally related transcriptional corepressors including Tup1 from yeast and Groucho from Drosophila. The nuclear localization of LEUNIG-GFP is consistent with a role of LEUNIG as a transcriptional regulator. The detection of LEUNIG mRNA in all floral whorls at the time of their inception suggests that the restricted activity of LEUNIG in the outer two floral whorls must depend on interactions with other spatially restricted factors or on posttranslational regulation. Our finding suggests that both animals and plants use similar repressor proteins to regulate critical developmental processes.	"Conner, J; Liu, Z. 2000.

MADS	Riechmann & Meyerowitz (1997): The MADS domain (MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, and SRF, serum response factor) is a conserved DNA-binding/dimerization region present in a variety of transcription factors from different kingdoms. MADS box genes represent a large multigene family in vascular plants. In angiosperms, many of the genes of the MADS family are involved in different steps of flower development, most notably in the determination of floral meristem and organ identity. The roles that MADS box genes play, however, are not restricted to control the development of the plant reproductive structures. The genetic, molecular, and biochemical basis of the action of the MADS domain proteins in the plant life cycle are reviewed here.	"Gramzow L.; Theissen G. 2010.

MBF1	Tsuda et al (2004): Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is known to be a transcriptional co-activator that mediates transcriptional activation by bridging between an activator and a TATA-box binding protein (TBP). We demonstrated that expression of every three MBF1 from Arabidopsis partially rescues the yeast mbf1 mutant phenotype, indicating that all of them function as co-activators for GCN4-dependent transcriptional activation. We also report that each of their subtypes shows distinct tissue-specific expression patterns and responses to phytohormones. These observations suggest that even though they share a similar biochemical function, each MBF1 has distinct roles in various tissues and conditions.

MYB-related	Martin & Paz-Ares (1997): The cloning of the first transcription factor from plants, the C1 gene of maize, indicated that plants use transcription factors that are structurally related to those of animals in their control of gene expression, because C1 showed significant structural homology to the vertebrate cellular proto-oncogene c-MYB. Since 1987, the catalogue of MYB-related transcription factors has increased considerably in size due, primarily, to the ever-expanding number of MYB genes identified in higher plants (Arabidopsis thaliana is estimated to contain more than a hundred MYB genes). In vertebrates, the MYB-related proto-oncogenes comprise a small family with a central role in controlling cellular proliferation and commitment to development. However, while the functions of some plant MYB genes are relatively well understood they are, at present, quite distinct from their animal counterparts.	"Jin, H; Martin, C. 1999.

Med6	Lee et al (1997): A temperature-sensitive mutation was obtained in Med6p, a component of the mediator complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mediator complex has been shown to enable transcriptional activation in vitro. This mutation in Med6p abolished activation of transcription from four of five inducible promoters tested in vivo. There was no effect, however, on uninduced transcription, transcription of constitutively expressed genes, or transcription by RNA polymerases I and III. Mediator-RNA polymerase II complex isolated from the mutant yeast strain was temperature sensitive for transcriptional activation in a reconstituted in vitro system due to a defect in initiation complex formation. A database search revealed the existence of MED6-related genes in humans and Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the role of mediator in transcriptional activation is conserved throughout the evolution.

The Med7N/31 submodule shows a conserved novel fold, with two proline-rich stretches in Med7N wrapping around the right-handed four-helix bundle of Med31. In vitro, Med7N/31 is required for activated transcription and can act in trans when added exogenously. In vivo, Med7N/31 has a predominantly positive function on the expression of a specific subset of genes, including genes involved in methionine metabolism and iron transport.

NZZ	Schiefthaler et al (1999): Sexual reproduction is a salient aspect of plants, and elaborate structures, such as the flowers of angiosperms, have evolved that aid in this process. Within the flower the corresponding sex organs, the anther and the ovule, form the male and female sporangia, the pollen sac and the nucellus, respectively. However, despite their central role for sexual reproduction little is known about the mechanisms that control the establishment of these important structures. Here we present the identification and molecular characterization of the NOZZLE (NZZ) gene in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In several nzz mutants the nucellus and the pollen sac fail to form. It indicates that NZZ plays an early and central role in the development of both types of sporangia and that the mechanisms controlling these processes share a crucial factor. In addition, NZZ may have an early function during male and female sporogenesis as well. The evolutionary aspects of these findings are discussed. NZZ encodes a putative protein of unknown function. However, based on sequence analysis we speculate that NZZ is a nuclear protein and possibly a transcription factor.

PHD	Bienz (2006): PHD proteins seem to be found universally in the nucleus, and their functions tend to lie in the control of chromatin or transcription. Increasing evidence indicates that PHD fingers bind to specific nuclear protein partners, for which they apparently use their loop 2 surface. Perhaps each PHD finger has its own cognate nuclear ligand, much like RING fingers have their cognate E2 ligases. No doubt the list of specific PHD finger ligands will grow, and the set of these ligands is likely to reveal whether PHD fingers have a common function in the nucleus.	"Bienz, M. 2006.

PLATZ	Nagano et al (2001): Complementary DNA encoding a DNA-binding protein, designated PLATZ1 (plant AT-rich sequence- and zinc-binding protein 1), was isolated from peas. The amino acid sequence of the protein is similar to those of other uncharacterized proteins predicted from the genome sequences of higher plants. However, no paralogous sequences have been found outside the plant kingdom. Multiple alignments among these paralogous proteins show that several cysteine and histidine residues are invariant, suggesting that these proteins are a novel class of zinc-dependent DNA-binding proteins with two distantly located regions, C-x(2)-H-x(11)-C-x(2)-C-x((4-5))-C-x(2)-C-x((3-7))-H-x(2)-H and C-x(2)-C-x((10-11))-C-x(3)-C. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the zinc chelator 1,10-o-phenanthroline inhibited DNA binding, and two distant zinc-binding regions were required for DNA binding. A protein blot with (65)ZnCl(2) showed that both regions are required for zinc-binding activity. The PLATZ1 protein non-specifically binds to A/T-rich sequences, including the upstream region of the pea GTPase pra2 and plastocyanin petE genes. Expression of the PLATZ1 repressed those of the reporter constructs containing the coding sequence of luciferase gene driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S90 promoter fused to the tandem repeat of the A/T-rich sequences. These results indicate that PLATZ1 is a novel class of plant-specific zinc-dependent DNA-binding protein responsible for A/T-rich sequence-mediated transcriptional repression.

RWP-RK	Schauser et al (2005): Genetic studies in Lotus japonicus and pea have identified Nin as a core symbiotic gene required for establishing symbiosis between legumes and nitrogen fixing bacteria collectively called Rhizobium. Sequencing of additional Lotus cDNAs combined with analysis of genome sequences from Arabidopsis and rice reveals that Nin homologues in all three species constitute small gene families. In total, the Arabidopsis and rice genomes encode nine and three NIN-like proteins (NLPs), respectively. We present here a bioinformatics analysis and prediction of NLP evolution. On a genome scale we show that in Arabidopsis, this family has evolved through segmental duplication rather than through tandem amplification. Alignment of all predicted NLP protein sequences shows a composition with six conserved modules. In addition, Lotus and pea NLPs contain segments that might characterize NIN proteins of legumes and be of importance for their function in symbiosis. The most conserved region in NLPs, the RWP-RK domain, has secondary structure predictions consistent with DNA binding properties. This motif is shared by several other small proteins in both Arabidopsis and rice. In rice, the RWP-RK domain sequences have diversified significantly more than in Arabidopsis. Database searches reveal that, apart from its presence in Arabidopsis and rice, the motif is also found in the algae Chlamydomonas and in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Thus, the origin of this putative DNA binding region seems to predate the fungus-plant divide.	"Schauser, L; Roussis, A; Stiller, J; Stougaard, J. 1999.

Rcd1-like	Okazaki et al (1998): In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the onset of sexual development is controlled mainly by two external signals, nutrient starvation and mating pheromone availability. We have isolated a novel gene named rcd1+ as a key factor required for nitrogen starvation-induced sexual development. rcd1+ encodes a 283-amino-acid protein with no particular motifs. However, genes highly homologous to rcd1+ (encoding amino acids with >70% identity) are present at least in budding yeasts, plants, nematodes, and humans. Cells with rcd1+ deleted are sterile if sexual development is induced by nitrogen starvation but fertile if it is induced by glucose starvation. This results largely from a defect in nitrogen starvation-invoked induction of ste11+, a key transcriptional factor gene required for the onset of sexual development. The striking conservation of the gene throughout eukaryotes may suggest the presence of an evolutionarily conserved differentiation controlling system.

S1Fa-like	Zhou et al (1995): A cDNA encoding a specific binding activity for the tissue-specific negative cis-element S1F binding site of spinach rps1 was isolated from a spinach cDNA expression library.

SAP	Byzova et al (1999): A recessive mutation in the Arabidopsis STERILE APETALA (SAP) causes severe aberrations in inflorescence and flower and ovule development. In sap flowers, sepals are carpelloid, petals are short and narrow or absent, and anthers are degenerated. Megasporogenesis, the process of meiotic divisions preceding the female gametophyte formation, is arrested in sap ovules during or just after the first meiotic division. More severe aberrations were observed in double mutants between sap and mutant alleles of the floral homeotic gene APETALA2 (AP2) suggesting that both genes are involved in the initiation of female gametophyte development. Together with the organ identity gene AGAMOUS (AG) SAP is required for the maintenance of floral identity acting in a manner similar to APETALA1. In contrast to the outer two floral organs in sap mutant flowers, normal sepals and petals develop in ag/sap double mutants, indicating that SAP negatively regulates AG expression in the perianth whorls. This supposed cadastral function of SAP is supported by in situ hybridization experiments showing ectopic expression of AG in the sap mutant. We have cloned the SAP gene by transposon tagging and revealed that it encodes a novel protein with sequence motifs, that are also present in plant and animal transcription regulators. Consistent with the mutant phenotype, SAP is expressed in inflorescence and floral meristems, floral organ primordia, and ovules. Taken together, we propose that SAP belongs to a new class of transcription regulators essential for a number of processes in Arabidopsis flower development.

We present here characterisation of 12 members of the SPL gene family. These genes show highly diverse genomic organisations and are found scattered over the Arabidopsis genome. Some SPL genes are constitutively expressed, while transcriptional activity of others is under developmental control. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction, gene structure and expression patterns, they can be divided into subfamilies. In addition to the Arabidopsis SPL genes, we isolated and determined the sequences of three SBP-box genes from Antirrhinum majus and seven from Zea mays.

SET	Marmorstein (2003): The methylation of lysine residues on histone tails is catalyzed by proteins containing a conserved SET domain. A recent flurry of structures of SET domain proteins has revealed a new protein fold and a scaffold for understanding catalysis and substrate binding by these enzymes. The prospect that histone methylation might form an epigenetic code and the implicated involvement of SET domain proteins in cancer assures that structure-function studies of these enzymes will continue until their detailed mechanism of action is determined.

SOH1	Fan et al (1996): The soh1, soh2 and soh4 mutants were isolated as suppressors of the temperature-dependent growth of the hyperrecombination mutant hpr1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cloning and sequence analysis of these suppressor genes has unexpectedly shown them to code for components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex. SOH2 is identical to RPB2, which encodes the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and SOH4 is the same as SUA7, encoding the yeast transcription initiation factor TFIIB. SOH1 encodes a novel 14-kD protein with limited sequence similarity to RNA polymerases. Interestingly, SOH1 not only interacts with factors involved in DNA repair, but transcription as well. Thus, the Soh1 protein may serve to couple these two processes. The Soh1 protein interacts with a DNA repair protein, Rad5p, in a two-hybrid system assay. Soh1p may functionally interact with components of the RNA polymerase II complex as suggested from the synthetic lethality observed in soh1 rpb delta 104, soh1 soh2-1 (rpb2), and soh1 soh4 (sua7) double mutants. Because mutations in SOH1, RPB2 and SUA7 suppress the hyperrecombination phenotype of hpr1 mutants, this suggests a link between recombination in direct repeats and transcription.

SRS	Fridborg et al (2001): The current model of gibberellin (GA) signal transduction is based on a derepressible system and a number of candidate negative regulators have been identified in Arabidopsis. We previously have reported the identification of the Arabidopsis gene SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) that causes suppression of GA responses when constitutively activated. In this paper, we show by using reporter gene analysis that the SHI gene is expressed in young organs, e.g. shoot apices and root tips. The model predicts a suppressor of GA responses to be active in these tissues to prevent premature growth or development. To study the effect of SHI on GA signaling, we used a functional assay that measures effects of signaling components on a well-defined GA response; the up-regulation of alpha-amylase in barley (Hordeum vulgare) aleurones in response to GA treatment. We found that SHI was able to specifically block the activity of a high-isoelectric point alpha-amylase promoter following GA(3) treatment, which further supports that SHI is a suppressor of GA responses. We have identified two putative loss-of-function insertion alleles of SHI and lines homozygous for either of the new alleles show no phenotypic deviations from wild type. Because SHI belongs to a gene family consisting of nine members, we suggest that SHI and the SHI-related genes are functionally redundant. We also show that a functional ERECTA allele is able to partly suppress the dwarfing effect of the shi gain-of-function mutation, suggesting that the erecta mutation harbored by the Landsberg erecta ecotype is an enhancer of the shi dwarf phenotype.

SWI/SNF_BAF60b	Kussie et al (1996): The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

SWI/SNF_SNF2	Eisen et al (1995): The SNF2 family of proteins includes representatives from a variety of species with roles in cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation (e.g. MOT1, SNF2 and BRM), maintenance of chromosome stability during mitosis (e.g. lodestar) and various aspects of processing of DNA damage, including nucleotide excision repair (e.g. RAD16 and ERCC6), recombinational pathways (e.g. RAD54) and post-replication daughter strand gap repair (e.g. RAD5). This family also includes many proteins with no known function. To better characterize this family of proteins we have used molecular phylogenetic techniques to infer evolutionary relationships among the family members. We have divided the SNF2 family into multiple subfamilies, each of which represents what we propose to be a functionally and evolutionarily distinct group. We have then used the subfamily structure to predict the functions of some of the uncharacterized proteins in the SNF2 family. We discuss possible implications of this evolutionary analysis on the general properties and evolution of the SNF2 family.	"Bork, P; Koonin, EV. 1993.

SWI/SNF_SWI3	Da et al (2006): The SWIRM domain is a module found in the Swi3 and Rsc8 subunits of SWI/SNF-family chromatin remodeling complexes, and the Ada2 and BHC110/LSD1 subunits of chromatin modification complexes. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the SWIRM domain from Swi3 and characterize the in vitro and in vivo function of the SWIRM domains from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Swi3 and Rsc8. The Swi3 SWIRM forms a four-helix bundle containing a pseudo 2-fold axis and a helix-turn-helix motif commonly found in DNA-binding proteins. We show that the Swi3 SWIRM binds free DNA and mononucleosomes with high and comparable affinity and that a subset of Swi3 substitution mutants that display growth defects in vivo also show impaired DNA-binding activity in vitro, consistent with a nucleosome targeting function of this domain. Genetic and biochemical studies also reveal that the Rsc8 and Swi3 SWIRM domains are essential for the proper assembly and in vivo functions of their respective complexes. Together, these studies identify the SWIRM domain as an essential multifunctional module for the regulation of gene expression.

Sigma70-like	Allison (2000): Expression of plastid genes is controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in response to developmental and environmental signals. In many cases this regulation is mediated by nuclear-encoded proteins acting in concert with the endogenous plastid gene expression machinery. Transcription in plastids is accomplished by two distinct RNA polymerase enzymes, one of which resembles eubacterial RNA polymerases in both subunit structure and promoter recognition properties. The holoenzyme contains a catalytic core composed of plastid-encoded subunits, assembled with a nuclear-encoded promoter-specificity factor, sigma. Based on examples of transcriptional regulation in bacteria, it is proposed that differential activation of sigma factors may provide the nucleus with a mechanism to control expression of groups of plastid genes. Hence, much effort has focused on identifying and characterizing sigma-like factors in plants. While fractionation studies had identified several candidate sigma factors in purified RNA polymerase preparations, it was only 4 years ago that the first sigma factor genes were cloned from two photosynthetic eukaryotes, both of which were red algae. More recently this achievement has extended to the identification of families of sigma-like factor genes from several species of vascular plants. Now, efforts in the field are directed at understanding the roles in plastid transcription of each member of the rapidly expanding plant sigma factor gene family. Recent results suggest that accumulation of individual sigma-like factors is controlled by light, by plastid type and/or by a particular stage of chloroplast development. These data mesh nicely with accumulating evidence that the core sigma-binding regions of plastid promoters mediate regulated transcription in response to light-regime and plastid type or developmental state. In this review I will outline progress made to date in identifying and characterizing the sigma-like factors of plants, and in dissecting their potential roles in chloroplast gene expression.

TAZ	Du & Poovaiah (2004): A novel CaM-binding protein was isolated through protein-protein interaction based screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA expression library using a 35S calmodulin (CaM) probe. There are four additional homologs in the Arabidopsis genome with similar structures: a BTB domain in the N-terminus and a Zf-TAZ domain in the C-terminus. Hence, they were designated as AtBT1-5 (Arabidopsis thaliana BTB and TAZ domain protein). CaM-binding experiments revealed that all five AtBTs are CaM-binding proteins, and their CaM-binding domains were mapped to the C-terminus. AtBT homologs are also present in rice, but are not present in human, animal, yeast or other organisms, suggesting that the BTB and TAZ domain proteins are plant-specific. The AtBT1-smGFP fusion protein expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells showed that AtBT1 targets the nucleus. Yeast two-hybrid screening using an AtBT1 fragment as bait identified two interacting proteins (AtBET10 and AtBET9) belonging to the family of fsh/Ring3 class transcription regulators. The BTB domain of the AtBTs is required for the interaction, and this protein-protein interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down. AtBET10 also interacts with AtBT2 and AtBT4, and exhibited a transcriptional activation function in yeast cells. AtBTs exhibit varying responses to different stress stimuli, but all five genes responded rapidly to H2O2 and salicylic acid (SA) treatments. These results suggest that AtBTs play a role in transcriptional regulation, and signal molecules such as Ca2+, H2O2, and SA affect transcriptional machinery by altering the expression and conformation of AtBTs which interact with transcriptional activators such as AtBET10.

TRAF	Stogios et al (2005): The BTB domain (also known as the POZ domain) is a versatile protein-protein interaction motif that participates in a wide range of cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, cytoskeleton dynamics, ion channel assembly and gating, and targeting proteins for ubiquitination. Several BTB domain structures have been experimentally determined, revealing a highly conserved core structure. The BTB domain is typically found as a single copy in proteins that contain only one or two other types of domain, and this defines the BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF), BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK), voltage-gated potassium channel T1 (T1-Kv), MATH-BTB, BTB-NPH3 and BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) families of proteins, among others. BTB-ZF proteins are also known as the POK (POZ and Krüppel zinc finger) proteins. Many members of this large family have been characterized as important transcriptional factors, and several are implicated in development and cancer, most notably BCL6, leukemia/lymphoma related factor (LRF)/Pokemon, PLZF, hypermethylated in cancer (HIC)1 and Myc interacting zinc finger (MIZ)1.

TUB	Lai et al (2004): In mammals, TUBBY-like proteins play an important role in maintenance and function of neuronal cells during postdifferentiation and development. We have identified a TUBBY-like protein gene family with 11 members in Arabidopsis, named AtTLP1-11. Although seven of the AtTLP genes are located on chromosome I, no local tandem repeats or gene clusters are identified. Except for AtTLP4, reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicates that all these genes are expressed in various organs in 6-week-old Arabidopsis. AtTLP1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 are expressed ubiquitously in all the organs tested, but the expression of AtTLP5 and 8 shows dramatic organ specificity. These 11 family members share 30% to 80% amino acid similarities across their conserved C-terminal tubby domains. Unlike the highly diverse N-terminal region of animal TUBBY-like proteins, all AtTLP members except AtTLP8 contain a conserved F-box domain (51-57 residues). The interaction between AtTLP9 and ASK1 (Arabidopsis Skp1-like 1) is confirmed via yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid assays. Abscisic acid (ABA)-insensitive phenotypes are observed for two independent AtTLP9 mutant lines, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing AtTLP9 are hypersensitive to ABA. These results suggest that AtTLP9 may participate in the ABA signaling pathway.	"Boggon, TJ; Shan, WS; Santagata, S; Myers, SC; Shapiro, L. 1999.

ULT	Carles et al (2005): The higher-plant shoot apical meristem is a dynamic structure continuously producing cells that become incorporated into new leaves, stems and flowers. The maintenance of a constant flow of cells through the meristem depends on coordination of two antagonistic processes: self-renewal of the stem cell population and initiation of the lateral organs. This coordination is stringently controlled by gene networks that contain both positive and negative components. We have previously defined the ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) gene as a key negative regulator of cell accumulation in Arabidopsis shoot and floral meristems, because mutations in ULT1 cause the enlargement of inflorescence and floral meristems, the production of supernumerary flowers and floral organs, and a delay in floral meristem termination. Here, we show that ULT1 negatively regulates the size of the WUSCHEL (WUS)-expressing organizing center in inflorescence meristems. We have cloned the ULT1 gene and find that it encodes a small protein containing a B-box-like motif and a SAND domain, a DNA-binding motif previously reported only in animal transcription factors. ULT1 and its Arabidopsis paralog ULT2 define a novel small gene family in plants. ULT1 and ULT2 are expressed coordinately in embryonic shoot apical meristems, in inflorescence and floral meristems, and in developing stamens, carpels and ovules. Additionally, ULT1 is expressed in vegetative meristems and leaf primordia. ULT2 protein can compensate for mutant ULT1 protein when overexpressed in an ult1 background, indicating that the two genes may regulate a common set of targets during plant development. Downregulation of both ULT genes can lead to shoot apical meristem arrest shortly after germination, revealing a requirement for ULT activity in early development.

VARL	Duncan et al (2007): Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Volvox carteri, and their relatives in the family Volvocaceae provide an excellent opportunity for studying how multicellular organisms with differentiated cell types evolved from unicellular ancestors. While C. reinhardtii is unicellular, V. carteri is multicellular with two cell types, one of which resembles C. reinhardtii cytologically but is terminally differentiated. Maintenance of this "somatic cell" fate is controlled by RegA, a putative transcription factor. We recently showed that RegA shares a conserved region with several predicted V. carteri and C. reinhardtii proteins and that this region, the VARL domain, is likely to include a DNA-binding SAND domain. As the next step toward understanding the evolutionary origins of the regA gene, we analyzed the genome sequences of C. reinhardtii and V. carteri to identify additional genes with the potential to encode VARL domain proteins. Here we report that the VARL gene family, which consists of 12 members in C. reinhardtii and 14 in V. carteri, has experienced a complex evolutionary history in which members of the family have been both gained and lost over time, although several pairs of potentially orthologous genes can still be identified. We find that regA is part of a tandem array of four VARL genes in V. carteri but that a similar array is absent in C. reinhardtii. Most importantly, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that a proto-regA gene was present in a common unicellular ancestor of V. carteri and C. reinhardtii and that this gene was lost in the latter lineage.

VOZ	Mitsuda et al (2004): A 38-bp pollen-specific cis-acting region of the AVP1 gene is involved in the expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana V-PPase during pollen development. Here, we report the isolation and structural characterization of AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2, novel transcription factors that bind to the 38-bp cis-acting region of A. thaliana V-PPase gene, AVP1. AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 show 53% amino acid sequence similarity. Homologs of AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 are found in various vascular plants as well as a moss, Physcomitrella patens. Promoter-beta-glucuronidase reporter analysis shows that AtVOZ1 is specifically expressed in the phloem tissue and AtVOZ2 is strongly expressed in the root. In vivo transient effector-reporter analysis in A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells demonstrates that AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 function as transcriptional activators in the Arabidopsis cell. Two conserved regions termed Domain-A and Domain-B were identified from an alignment of AtVOZ proteins and their homologs of O. sativa and P. patens. AtVOZ2 binds as a dimer to the specific palindromic sequence, GCGTNx7ACGC, with Domain-B, which is comprised of a functional novel zinc coordinating motif and a conserved basic region. Domain-B is shown to function as both the DNA-binding and the dimerization domains of AtVOZ2. From highly the conservative nature among all identified VOZ proteins, we conclude that Domain-B is responsible for the DNA binding and dimerization of all VOZ-family proteins and designate it as the VOZ-domain.

WRKY	Wu et al (2005): WRKY transcription factors, originally isolated from plants contain one or two conserved WRKY domains, about 60 amino acid residues with the WRKYGQK sequence followed by a C2H2 or C2HC zinc finger motif. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that the WRKY proteins play significant roles in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and in development. In this research, we identified 102 putative WRKY genes from the rice genome and compared them with those from Arabidopsis. The WRKY genes from rice and Arabidopsis were divided into three groups with several subgroups on the basis of phylogenies and the basic structure of the WRKY domains (WDs). The phylogenetic trees generated from the WDs and the genes indicate that the WRKY gene family arose during evolution through duplication and that the dramatic amplification of rice WRKY genes in group III is due to tandem and segmental gene duplication compared with those of Arabidopsis. The result suggests that some of the rice WRKY genes in group III are evolutionarily more active than those in Arabidopsis, and may have specific roles in monocotyledonous plants. Further, it was possible to identify the presence of WRKY-like genes in protists (Giardia lamblia and Dictyostelium discoideum) and green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through database research, demonstrating the ancient origin of the gene family. The results obtained by alignments of the WDs from different species and other analysis imply that domain gain and loss is a divergent force for expansion of the WRKY gene family, and that a rapid amplification of the WRKY genes predate the divergence of monocots and dicots. On the basis of these results, we believe that genes encoding a single WD may have been derived from the C-terminal WD of the genes harboring two WDs. The conserved intron splicing positions in the WDs of higher plants offer clues about WRKY gene evolution, annotation, and classification.	"Eulgem, T; Rushton, PJ; Robatzek, S; Somssich, IE. 2000.

Zinc finger, ZPR1	<a target="_blank" class="awithout" href="http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF03367">PFAM</a> (0):  The zinc-finger protein ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm in quiescent cells; in proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens it accumulates in the nucleolus. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the nucleolus. ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA expression. The ZPR1 domain consists of an elongation initiation factor 2-like zinc finger and a double-stranded beta helix with a helical hairpin insertion.

Zn_clus	Pan & Coleman (1990): The DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor GAL4, consisting of the 62 N-terminal residues and denoted GAL4(62*), contains a Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa6+ ++-Cys motif, which has been shown previously to bind two Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions. Binding of Zn(II) or Cd(II) is essential for the recognition by GAL4 of the specific palindromic DNA sequence to which it binds upstream of genes for galactose-metabolizing enzymes, the UASG sequence. On the basis of the 113Cd NMR chemical shifts of the two bound 113Cd(II) ions, we propose a binuclear cluster model for this Zn(II)-binding subdomain. 1H-113Cd heteronuclear multiple-quantum NMR spectroscopy and phase-sensitive double-quantum filtered 1H correlation spectroscopy of the 112Cd(II)- and 113Cd(II)-substituted GAL4(62*) derivatives provide direct evidence that the two bound 113Cd(II) ions are coordinated only by the six cysteine residues, two of which form bridging ligands between the two 113Cd(II) ions. The latter can be identified from the pattern of 1H-113Cd J coupling. Thus a binuclear metal ion cluster rather than a "zinc finger" is formed by the six cysteine residues of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. This model can be directly applied to eight other fungal transcription factors which have been shown to contain similarly spaced Cys6 clusters. 1H NMR spectra of apo-GAL4(62*) suggest conformational fluctuation of the metal-binding subdomain upon removal of Zn(II) or Cd(II). Both Cd(II)2- and Zn(II)2-containing species of GAL4 can be formed, and the similar 1H NMR spectra suggest similar conformations.	"Pan, T; Coleman, JE. 1990.

bHLH	Buck & Atchley (2003): The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of proteins is a group of functionally diverse transcription factors found in both plants and animals. These proteins evolved early in eukaryotic cells before the split of animals and plants, but appear to function in lsquoplant-specificrsquo or lsquoanimal-specificrsquo processes. In animals bHLH proteins are involved in regulation of a wide variety of essential developmental processes. On the contrary, bHLH proteins have not been extensively studied in plants. Those that have been characterized function in anthocyanin biosynthesis, phytochrome signaling, globulin expression, fruit dehiscence, carpel and epidermal development.	"Buck, MJ; Atchley, WR. 2003.

bHLH_TCP	Kosugi & Ohashi (2002): The TCP domain is a plant-specific DNA binding domain found in proteins from a diverse array of species, including the cycloidea (cyc) and teosinte branched1 (tb1) gene products and the PCF1 and PCF2 proteins. To understand the role in transcriptional regulation of proteins with this domain, we have analysed the DNA binding and dimerization specificity of the TCP protein family using rice PCF proteins, and further evaluated potential targets for the TCP protein. The seven PCF members including five newly isolated proteins, were able to be grouped into two classes, I and II, based on sequence similarity in the TCP domain. Random binding site selection experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed the consensus DNA binding sequences of these two classes to be distinct but overlapping; GGNCCCAC for class I and GTGGNCCC for class II. The TB1 protein from maize, which belongs to class II, had the same specificity as the rice class II proteins, suggesting the conservation of binding specificity between TCP domains from different species. The yeast 2-hybrid assay and EMSA revealed that these proteins tend to form a homodimer or a heterodimer between members of the same class. We searched predicted 5' flanking sequences of Arabidopsis genes for the consensus binding sequences and found that the consensus sites are distributed in the genome at a considerably lower frequency. We further analysed eight promoters containing the class I consensus TCP sites. The transcriptional activities of six promoters were decreased by a mutation of the TCP binding site, which is consistent with the observation that the class I TCP site can confer transactivation function on a heterologous promoter. These results suggest that the two classes of TCP protein are distinct in DNA binding specificity and transcriptional regulation.	"Cubas, P; Lauter, N; Doebley, J; Coen, E. 1999.

mTERF	Roberti et al (2009): The MTERF family is a wide protein family, identified in Metazoa and plants, which consists of 4 subfamilies named MTERF1-4. Proteins belonging to this family are localized in mitochondria and have a modular architecture based on repetitions of a 30 amino acid module, the mTERF motif, containing leucine zipper-like heptads. The MTERF family includes the characterized transcription termination factors human mTERF, sea urchin mtDBP and Drosophila DmTTF. In vitro and in vivo studies show that these factors play different roles which are not restricted to transcription termination, but concern also transcription inititiation and the control of mtDNA replication. The multiplicity of functions could be related to the differences in the gene organization of the mitochondrial genomes. Studies on the function of human and Drosophila MTERF3 factor showed that the protein acts as negative regulator of mitochondrial transcription, possibly in cooperation with other still unknown factors. The complete elucidation of the role of the MTERF family members will allow to unravel the molecular mechanisms of mtDNA transcription and replication.

tify	Nishii et al (2000): By differential screening of an arrayed normalized cDNA library from the inflorescence apex in Arabidopsis, a cDNA clone having a deduced amino acid sequence with a motif for a zinc finger was isolated as one of the genes expressed specifically in the reproductive phase. The deduced protein has a modular structure with a putative single C2-C2 zinc-finger motif distantly related to a GATA-1-type finger, a basic region with a sequence resembling a nuclear localization signal, and an acidic region. The gene seemed to have been formed by the exon-shuffling during its molecular evolution, since individual domains are encoded by discrete exons. RNA gel blot analysis showed its expression in shoot apex and flowers in the reproductive phase. The gene was named ZIM for Zinc-finger protein expressed in Inflorescence Meristem. The nuclear localization of ZIM was detected using GFP as a reporter. These results suggest that ZIM is a putative transcription factor involved in inflorescence and flower development.

ALOG	Arabidopsis thaliana LSH1 and Oryza G1 proteins are abbreviated with ALOG and also referred to as light-dependent short hypocotyl (LSH) proteins (Lee et al., 2020).

C2H2_IDD	The Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc-finger protein family is present in all eukaryotes and among the largest families of eukaryotic transcription factors (Seetharam & Stuart, 2013). One identified plant-specific subfamily of this large protein family is the Indeterminate Domain (IDD) subfamily of TFs, which was first reported in Zea mays (Coelho et al., 2018; Prochetto & Reinheimer, 2020). Proteins belonging to the IDD subfamily can be distinguished from the remaining C2H2 members by the fact that they contain a highly conserved N-terminal IDD domain in addition to further C2H2 zinc finger domains (Prochetto & Reinheimer, 2020). Among previously identified functions controlled by C2H2-IDD proteins are metabolic and development processes like flowering time, root development, leaf differentiation and the regulation of the C4 Kranz anatomy (Coelho et al., 2018; Prochetto & Reinheimer, 2020).

MYST	Lysine acetyltransferases or histone acetyltransferases (HATs) together with histone deacetylases (HDACs), are responsible for reversible acetylation of histones and are found in eukaryotes in at least four TR families, namely MYST (MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2 and TIP60), CBP (p300/CREB-binding protein), TAFII250 (TATA-binding protein associated factor) and GNAT (GCN5-related N-terminal acetyltransferase) (Boycheva et al., 2014; Pandey, 2002; Uhrig et al., 2017).

AS2/LOB	"Conserved in a variety of evolutionarily divergent plant species, LOB DOMAIN (LBD) genes define a large, plant-specific family of largely unknown function. LBD genes have been implicated in a variety of developmental processes in plants, although to date, relatively few members have been assigned functions. LBD proteins have previously been predicted to be transcription factors, however supporting evidence has only been circumstantial. To address the biochemical function of LBD proteins, we identified a 6-bp consensus motif recognized by a wide cross-section of LBD proteins, and showed that LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB), the founding member of the family, is a transcriptional activator in yeast. Thus, the LBD genes encode a novel class of DNA-binding transcription factors. Post-translational regulation of transcription factors is often crucial for control of gene expression. In our study, we demonstrate that members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors are capable of interacting with LOB. The expression patterns of bHLH048 and LOB overlap at lateral organ boundaries. Interestingly, the interaction of bHLH048 with LOB results in reduced affinity of LOB for the consensus DNA motif. Thus, our studies suggest that bHLH048 post-translationally regulates the function of LOB at lateral organ boundaries (Husbands et al., 2007). According to (Huang et al., 2020) and (Zhang et al., 2020) the LBD family members can be classified into two subfamilies, namely class I and class II LBD proteins. These two classes are distinguished in their domain motifs. Compared to class I proteins, class II proteins lack an intact leucine-zipper-like domain (Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, zinc-finger motifs and GAS (Gly-Ala-Ser) blocks are present in both classes (Zhang et al., 2020)."	"Husbands, A; Bell, EM; Shuai, B; Smith, HM; Springer, PS. 2007.

MYB	"Martin & Paz-Ares (1997): The cloning of the first transcription factor from plants, the C1 gene of maize, indicated that plants use transcription factors that are structurally related to those of animals in their control of gene expression, because C1 showed significant structural homology to the vertebrate cellular proto-oncogene c-MYB. Since 1987, the catalogue of MYB-related transcription factors has increased considerably in size due, primarily, to the ever-expanding number of MYB genes identified in higher plants (Arabidopsis thaliana is estimated to contain more than a hundred MYB genes). In vertebrates, the MYB-related proto-oncogenes comprise a small family with a central role in controlling cellular proliferation and commitment to development. However, while the functions of some plant MYB genes are relatively well understood they are, at present, quite distinct from their animal counterparts. MYB TFs exhibit a highly conserved N-terminal MYB domain, which consists of one to four imperfect sequence repeats (Cao et al., 2020; Dubos et al., 2010). Based on the occurrence of these repeats, proteins belonging to the MYB family can be classified into four subfamilies, namely MYB-1R, MYB-2R, MYB-3R and MYB-4R (Cao et al., 2020)."

CRF	"(Rashotte & Goertzen, 2010) specify Cytokinin Response Factors (CRFs) as a subset of the AP2/ERF TF family.

ET	"Based on the study of (Raventós et al., 1998), the TF family HRT (Hordeum repressor of transcription) was previously integrated into TAPscan. The authors introduced this protein family as proteins containing a gibberellin phytohormone response element and are therefore involved in developmental and phytohormone-responsive regulations (Raventós et al., 1998). However, a more recent study by (Tedeschi et al., 2019) characterized this family as EFFECTORS OF TRANSCRIPTION (ET). ET proteins are plant-specific transcription factors specified by highly conserved ET repeats and a GIY-YIG domain, a DNA single-strand nuclease domain (Tedeschi et al., 2019). In line with (Raventós et al., 1998), also (Ivanov et al., 2012) were able to demonstrate an involvement in the regulation of gibberellin to ensure correct seed development.

HD-NDX	"The homeobox TF superfamily is defined by an occurrence of the characteristic homeodomain (HD) and can be defined as pan-eukaryotic since it is found in all eukaryotic organisms (Catarino et al., 2016; Romani et al., 2018). According to different references (e.g., (Catarino et al., 2016; Mukherjee et al., 2009; Que et al., 2018)), the HD superfamily is divided into 11 subfamilies, namely BEL, DDT, HDZ, KNOX, LD, NDX, PHD, PINTOX, PLINC, SAWADEE and WOX. Interestingly, all subfamilies evolved in the common ancestor, before terrestrialization and diversification of land plants (Catarino et al., 2016). Furthermore, the broad distribution and high conservation of domains induces a common highly conserved functional role in plants and whenever members are present, also in algae (Mukherjee et al., 2009). In general, homeobox TFs show diverse functions in developmental and physiological mechanisms (Romani et al., 2018). In members of the NDX subfamily, an NDX (Nodulin Homeobox genes) domain is expected in addition to the homeodomain (Mukherjee et al., 2009)."	"Catarino, B., Hetherington, A. J., Emms, D.
