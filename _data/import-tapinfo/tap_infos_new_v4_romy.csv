ALOG	“Arabidopsis thaliana LSH1 and Oryza G1 proteins are abbreviated with 'ALOG' and also referred to as light-dependent short hypocotyl (LSH) proteins (Lee et al., 2020). These proteins represent a family of TFs which can be found in all land plants and some streptophyte algae (Naramoto et al., 2020). ALOG proteins are involved i.e. in the elongation of the hypocotyl, in the determination of the lateral organ identity and in the conservation of the apical meristems (e.g., (Cho & Zambryski, 2011; Naramoto et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2004)). (Naramoto et al., 2020) identified, based on the occurrences of ALOG proteins in some streptophyte algae, that the ALOG TF family emerged before the evolution of land plants and is present in species that feature traits like apical growth, plasmodesmata and rhizoids (Naramoto et al., 2020)."

C2H2-IDD	"The Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc-finger protein family is present in all eukaryotes and among the largest families of eukaryotic transcription factors (Seetharam & Stuart, 2013). One identified plant-specific subfamily of this large protein family is the Indeterminate Domain (IDD) subfamily of TFs, which was first reported in Zea mays (Coelho et al., 2018; Prochetto & Reinheimer, 2020). Proteins belonging to the IDD subfamily can be distinguished from the remaining C2H2 members by the fact that they contain a highly conserved N-terminal IDD domain in addition to further C2H2 zinc finger domains (Prochetto & Reinheimer, 2020). Among previously identified functions controlled by C2H2-IDD proteins are metabolic and development processes like flowering time, root development, leaf differentiation and the regulation of the C4 Kranz anatomy (Coelho et al., 2018; Prochetto & Reinheimer, 2020)."

MYST	"Lysine acetyltransferases or histone acetyltransferases (HATs) together with histone deacetylases (HDACs), are responsible for reversible acetylation of histones and are found in eukaryotes in at least four TR families, namely MYST (MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2 and TIP60), CBP (p300/CREB-binding protein), TAFII250 (TATA-binding protein associated factor) and GNAT (GCN5-related N-terminal acetyltransferase) (Boycheva et al., 2014; Pandey, 2002; Uhrig et al., 2017). HATs function as transcriptional regulators by having different regulatory effects on gene expression in plants, animals and fungi, indicating a high conservation of these proteins and their functions (Pandey, 2002). Especially in land plants, due to their sessile lifestyle, chromatin modifications provide an important mechanism in adapting to environmental stresses (Boycheva et al., 2014). The HAT subfamily MYST can be found with an average of two members in green algae, land plants, heterokonts and other photosynthetic eukaryotes involved for instances in transcriptional activation and silencing, apoptosis and in the process of the cell cycle (Latrasse et al., 2008; Uhrig et al., 2017)."
